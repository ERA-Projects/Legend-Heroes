The search, processing, and creation of the final graphics for the mod took about 3 years. Unfortunately, there were no AI modeling programs and networks at that time.

The mod does not impose the author's vision of the characters' graphics, but is used to customize the images of all the heroes in the game, their full body figures, portraits, as well as backgrounds and a number of decorative elements.

Any player, at their own discretion, can use the graphics offered by the mod, or add their own, including leaving versions from the original game. With the help of AI networks, the limit of imagination and creativity is now unlimited! It is possible that using graphical AI networks, the mod will be gradually updated with new graphics.

In addition, by editing the `Legend_Heroes.json`, the player can change and adjust to his liking the sizes/location on the game screens of images of heroes, backgrounds, decorative elements, artifact slots, their visible area.

It is planned to periodically update the mod by adding both improved existing images and new alternative versions.
